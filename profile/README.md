<p align="center">Build full-featured distributed apps — without the distributed complexity.</p>

---

Fluxzero is a next-generation platform for building scalable, resilient, and joyful backend applications. But it doesn’t stop at the backend. Our vision is to simplify app development across the stack — starting with what matters most: the core logic.

You write code that solves real business problems.  
Fluxzero takes care of the 50 things you'd rather not implement.

### The SDK
Our JVM-first SDK (Java, Kotlin, Scala) makes it easy to:

- Handle commands, queries, events, schedules, and web requests
- Persist messages, documents, snapshots, and metrics
- Scale from MVP to enterprise without rewrites
- Test your app behaviorally — right out of the box

Coming soon: support for more languages and platforms.
